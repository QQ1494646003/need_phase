  Up to  2022/12/12 the visualization work is not completed!
  In the future we will do this work continue until complete the visualization and packer this work into exe for easy use on Windows8/10/11
  If you want to use this code on other platform such as windows7(or lower vision)/linux/unix/macos , you should pay attention to that some packages of python is not supported by some python versions.
  Owing to the unspport of some CPU architectures,we will upload the C/C++ version for easyer code port (not contained visualization work,it based on the hardware partly).
