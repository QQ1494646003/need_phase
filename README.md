  the "main.py" is to caculate phase in the metasurface antenna 
  if you don't need to show the phase visualization by color please delete the next in the head of main.py

import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as  plt
"
  up to  2022/12/12 the visualization work is not completed!
  in the future we will do this work continue until complete the visualization and packer this work into exe for easy use on Windows8/10/11
  if you want to use this code on other platform such as windows7(or lower vision)/linux/unix/macos , you should pay attention to that some packages of 
python is not supported by some python versions.
  owing to the unspport of some CPU architectures,we will upload the C/C++ version for easyer code port (not contained visualization work,it based on the
hardware partly).
